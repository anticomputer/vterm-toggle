# vterm-toggle Toggle vterm buffer

[emacs-libvterm](https://github.com/akermu/emacs-libvterm) is fully-fledged terminal emulator inside GNU Emacs based on libvterm.

This package provides the command `vterm-toggle` which toggles between the vterm
buffer and whatever buffer you are editing.

 This is done in an "intelligent" way.  Features are:
 1. Starts a vterm if none is existent.
 2. Minimum distortion of your window configuration.
 3. When done in the vterm-buffer you are returned to the same window
    configuration you had before you toggled to the shell.
 4. If you desire, you automagically get a `cd` command in the shell to the
    directory where your current buffers file exists, just call `vterm-toggle-cd`
    instead of `vterm-toggle`.

```
(global-set-key [f2] 'vterm-toggle)
(global-set-key [C-f2] 'vterm-toggle-cd)

;; you can cd to the directory where your previous buffer file exists
;; after you have toggle to the vterm buffer with `vterm-toggle'.
(define-key vterm-mode-map [(control return)]   #'vterm-toggle-insert-cd)

;Switch to next vterm buffer
(define-key vterm-mode-map (kbd "s-n")   'vterm-toggle-forward)
;Switch to previous vterm buffer
(define-key vterm-mode-map (kbd "s-p")   'vterm-toggle-backward)

```

# Customize
## vterm-toggle-cd-auto-create-buffer
With
```
(setq vterm-toggle-cd-auto-create-buffer nil)
```
`vterm-toggle-cd`  would activate a recent vterm buffer even if no prompt can be found
(with vterm-toggle-use-dedicated-buffer still nil). So when the current buffer is not a vterm buffer,
it would always activate a recent vterm buffer if there is one but would only insert cd if the prompt is available.
And you can bind
```
(define-key vterm-mode-map [(control return)]   #'vterm-toggle-insert-cd)
```
## vterm-toggle-reset-window-configration-after-exit

`t` Reset window configuration after vterm buffer is killed.
`'kill-window-only` Kill Window only.

## vterm-toggle-hide-method
1. `delete-window`  Delete vterm window
2. `nil`  Toggle without closing the vterm window, just jump back-and-forth
    between vterm and a code buffer.
3. `reset-window-configration`  Reset window configration
## show vterm buffer in current window

## show  vterm buffer in side window
If you want show vterm buffer at bottom side window:
```
(setq vterm-toggle-fullscreen-p nil)

# work with centaur-tabs (select next/prev vterm buffer)

   https://github.com/ema2159/centaur-tabs/

You can customize `centaur-tabs` and make all vterm buffer in a tab group, and
use `centaur-tabs-forward` and `centaur-tabs-backward` switch from one vterm
buffer to another.

```
(global-set-key  (kbd "s-n") 'centaur-tabs-forward)
(global-set-key  (kbd "s-p") 'centaur-tabs-backward)
```

```
(setq centaur-tabs-buffer-groups-function 'vmacs-awesome-tab-buffer-groups)
(defun vmacs-awesome-tab-buffer-groups ()
  "`vmacs-awesome-tab-buffer-groups' control buffers' group rules. "
  (list
   (cond
    ((derived-mode-p 'eshell-mode 'term-mode 'shell-mode 'vterm-mode)
     "Term")
    ((string-match-p (rx (or
                          "\*Helm"
                          "\*helm"
                          "\*tramp"

                     (buffer-name))

(setq vterm-toggle--vterm-buffer-p-function 'vmacs-term-mode-p)

# vterm-toggle-use-dedicated-buffer
When  vterm-toggle-use-dedicated-buffer is not nil, you can toggle to a dedicated vterm buffer.

you can toggle to different dedicated buffer for different purpose.
For example, I want to replace default `compile` with my `vterm-compile`
```
(defvar vterm-compile-dedicated-buffer nil)
(defun vterm-compile ()
  (interactive)
  (let ((vterm-toggle-use-dedicated-buffer t)
        (vterm-toggle--vterm-dedicated-buffer vterm-compile-dedicated-buffer))
    (with-current-buffer (vterm-toggle-cd)
      (setq vterm-compile-dedicated-buffer (current-buffer))
      (rename-buffer "term compile")
      (compilation-shell-minor-mode 1)
      (vterm-send-string compile-command t)
      (vterm-send-return))
    )
  )
```
